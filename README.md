# Digital Skill Fair (DSF) 35.0 Data Science Portfolio
# Implementing Decision Trees on Iris dataset in Python
# Description Project
This project, developed as part of the Digital Skills Fair 35.0 by Dibimbing, aims to build a machine learning model capable of classifying Iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. A Decision Tree classifier is employed for this task due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in handling this type of classification problem.

## Datasets:
The project utilizes the widely-used Iris dataset, a classic benchmark dataset in machine learning and a staple in introductory data science education. It consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three Iris species. Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Goals
1. Classification: The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.
2. Model Evaluation: The Iris dataset is frequently used to evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms. Its simplicity and well-defined structure make it easy to compare the strengths and weaknesses of various models.
3. Educational Purposes: Due to its ease of understanding and accessibility, the Iris dataset is often used in introductory machine learning courses and tutorials to demonstrate basic concepts like data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. Algorithm Development: Researchers sometimes use the Iris dataset to develop and test new classification algorithms or variations of existing ones. The dataset's relatively small size allows for quick experimentation and testing.

# Insight
1. Decision Trees are effective for Iris classification: The project demonstrates that a Decision Tree classifier can achieve high accuracy (in this case, 100%) on the Iris dataset. This highlights the effectiveness of Decision Trees in handling this type of classification problem with relatively simple, linearly separable data.
2. Feature importance can be identified: By analyzing the Decision Tree structure (through visualization), you can gain insights into which features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) are most important for distinguishing between Iris species. This information can be valuable for understanding the underlying characteristics that differentiate the species.
3. Potential for overfitting: While achieving 100% accuracy is impressive, it's important to acknowledge the possibility of overfitting, especially with a small and simple dataset like Iris. This insight emphasizes the need for cautious interpretation of results and the importance of evaluating models on unseen data to assess their generalization ability.

# Results:
The Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the Iris dataset, indicating its ability to perfectly classify the three Iris species based on the provided features. However, achieving perfect accuracy on this relatively simple dataset might indicate overfitting. Further evaluation on a larger and more diverse dataset is recommended to assess the model's generalization ability.
