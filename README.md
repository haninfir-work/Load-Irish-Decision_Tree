# Digital Skill Fair (DSF) 35.0 Data Science Portfolio
# Implementing Decision Trees on Iris dataset in Python
# Description Project
This project explores the Iris dataset to build a model for classifying Iris flower species. It involves data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and building a Decision Tree classifier. The project aims to gain insights from the dataset, develop an accurate prediction model, and evaluate its performance.

## Datasets:
The project utilizes the widely-used Iris dataset, a classic benchmark dataset in machine learning and a staple in introductory data science education. It consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three Iris species. Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Project Goals
1. Explore and visualize the Iris dataset to understand its characteristics and relationships between features.
2. Build a Decision Tree model to predict Iris flower species based on their features.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and gain insights from the results.

# Insight
1. The Iris dataset is relatively easy to classify using a Decision Tree Classifier.
2. Petal length and petal width are the most important features for predicting the iris species.
3. The Decision Tree model achieved high accuracy on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness for this classification task.
4. The visualizations provided valuable insights into the relationships between features and the target variable, as well as the decision-making process of the model.

# Results:
The Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the Iris dataset, indicating its ability to perfectly classify the three Iris species based on the provided features. However, achieving perfect accuracy on this relatively simple dataset might indicate overfitting. Further evaluation on a larger and more diverse dataset is recommended to assess the model's generalization ability.
